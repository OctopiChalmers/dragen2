In this section, we show how to augment the automatic process of deriving random
data generators in {\dragen} with the structural information expressed by
patterns matchings and abstract interfaces.
%
The key idea of this work is to represent the different sources in an
homogeneous way.
%
%% I don't get this sentence
%Intuitively, the derived generators take the specification of the different
%structural sources and generate composite structured values on each random
%choice they perform.\todoale{remove this sentence?}
%

Figure \ref{fig:hrep} shows the workflow of our approach for the |Html| ADT.
%
Based on the codebase, the user of \dragenp indicates: (i) the ADT definition to
consider (noted as $\mathrm{Html_{ADT}}$), (ii) its patterns of interest (noted
$\mathrm{Html_{Patterns}}$), and (iii) the primitives from abstract interfaces
to involve in the generation process (noted as $\mathrm{Html_{Interface}}$).
%
% In this example, the user writes a type declaration as follows.
% \begin{code}
% type HtmlSpec  =         HtmlADT
%                  oplus'  HtmlPatterns
%                  oplus'  HtmlInterface
% \end{code}
%
Our tool then \emph{automatically derives generators} for each source of
structural information.
%
These generators produce random \emph{partial ADT values} in a way that it is
easier to combine them in order to create structural richer ones.
%
For instance, the generator obtained from $\mathrm{Html_{ADT}}$ only generates
constructors of the ADT but leaves the generation at the recursive fields
incomplete, e.g., it generates values of the form (|Text "xA2sx"|), (|Single
"xj32da"|), (|Tag "divx234jx" hole|) and (|Join hole hole|), where |hole| is a
placeholder denoting a ``yet-to-complete'' value.
%
%
% \todo[inline]{I think we should be consistent on where to put the holes, because
%   we are using them in places where we expect recursive values and strings as
%   well. I guess the original idea is to use them to represent only the recursive
%   holes.}
%
Similarly, the generator obtained from $\mathrm{Html_{Patterns}}$ generates values
satisfying the expected patterns where recursive fields are also left
uncompleted, e.g., it generates values of the form (|Join (Text "xxa34") (Text
"yxa123")|) and (|Join (Join (Text "xd32sa") hole) hole|).
%
Finally, the generator derived from $\mathrm{Html_{Interface}}$ generates calls to the
interface's primitives, where each argument of type |Html| is left uncompleted,
e.g., (|div hole|) and (|bold hole|).
%

Observe that \emph{partial ADT values} can be combined easily and the result is
still a well-formed value of type |Html|.
%
For instance, if we want to combine the following random generated ADT value
(|Text "xx34s"|), pattern (|Join (Join (Text "xd32sa") hole)|, and interface
call (|div hole|), we can obtain the following well-typed |Html| value:
%
\begin{code}
 Join (Join (Text "xd32sa") (div (Text "xx34s"))
\end{code}


Finally, our tool put all these three generators together into one that combines
partial ADT values into fully formed ones.
%
Importantly, the user can specify the desire distribution of the expected number
of constructors, patterns, and interface calls that the generator will produce.
%
All in all, our approach offers the following advantages over usual derivation
of random generators based only on ADT definitions:
%
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item \textbf{Composability:} our tool can combine different partial ADT values
  arising from different structural information sources depending on what
  property or sub-system becomes necessary to test using randomly generated
  values.
  %
\item \textbf{Extensibility:} the developer can specify new sources of
  structural information and combine them with the existing ones simply by
  adding them to the existing specification of the target ADT.
  %
\item \textbf{Predictability:} the tool is capable to synthesize generators
  which distribution is adjusted to what developers might desire, e.g., an
  uniform distribution of patterns, a distribution where some constructors are
  generated twice as much as others, etc. We explain the prediction of
  distributions in the next section.
  %
  % This prediction is completely modular, and can be obtained for any composite
  % representation obtained using the automatically derived |HRep|s and the
  % provided combinators.
\end{CompactItemize}


We remark that, for space reasons, we were only able to introduce the
specification of a rather simple target ADT like |Html|.
%
In practice, this reasoning can be extended to mutually recursive and parametric
ADT definitions as well.

% % Instead of generating each data constructor independently, a random generator
% % derived from this representation might generate composite structured values on
% % each random choice it performs.
% %
% % \footnote{The notion of higher-level comes from that the generation process is
% %   entirely determined by the type of the chosen type level representation,
% %   instead of by a concrete generator defined at the term level.}
% %
% For this purpose, we use a series of automatically derived data types, each one
% representing an atomic unit of information that can be randomly generated and
% then reflected back to the corresponding value of the original data type.
% %
% Later, the user can compose these atomic representations using the provided type
% level combinators in different ways into a ``generation specification'' that
% completely determines the generation process behavior.


% We wil reuse the previously defined data type |Html| and the functions defined
% in the previous section to explain the different concepts involved all across
% this section.


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Data Constructors}}

% We begin by introducing the simplest data type representation that we can
% extract from our codebase: the representation of single data constructor.
% %
% Each data constructor can be represented by an automatically derived data type
% consisting of a single constructor with the same fields as the original, except
% for the recursive ones that are abstracted away.
% %
% In this light, we represent each constructor of the data type |Html| as follows:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepText  r = ConText  String
% data HRepSing  r = ConSing  String
% data HRepJoin  r = ConJoin  r r
% data HRepTag   r = ConTag   String r
% \end{code}

% Note that the previous definitions are type parametric over the type parameter
% |r|.
% %
% This allow us to replace |r| with any concrete data type, obtaining different
% possible values on each case.
% %
% For instance, the value (|ConJoin 10 20|) has type |HRepJoin Int|, while the
% value (|ConJoin True False|) has type |HRepJoin Bool|.


% In practice, this parametricity let us instatiate |r| with the type of the
% chosen generation specification (which might be composed of several |HRep|s),
% without having to modify anything in the underlying machinery.


% Having the |HRep| of each data constructor, we can define an evaluation relation
% ($\evalrep{\_}{t} : \hrep{f} \rightarrow t$) that maps a value from each
% representation |f| back to the target data type |t|.
% %
% Then, we simply need to translate each constructor representation back into its
% corresponding one, translating the abstracted fields recursively:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{4}
%   &\evalrep{|ConText|\ s &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Text|\ s \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConSing|\ s &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Sing|\ s \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConJoin|\ x\ y &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Join|\ \evalrep{x}{Html}\ \evalrep{y}{Html} \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConTag|\ s\ x &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Tag|\ s\ \evalrep{x}{Html}
% \end{alignat*}

% The missing piece is to automatically synthesize a random generators for each
% constructor representation.
% %
% For this purpose, it is important to consider that each constructor |HRep| has
% its recursive fields abstracted away with a type parameter that will be later
% instantiated with the generation specification type.
% %
% Given that this specification is unknown at the derivation time, we parametrize
% each |HRep| generator with a random generator |genr| that is used to generate
% random values for each recursive field:

% \begin{code}
%   genText  genr  = ConText  <$> arbitrary
%   genSing  genr  = ConSing  <$> arbitrary
%   genJoin  genr  = ConJoin  <$> smaller genr <*> smaller genr
%   genTag   genr  = ConTag   <$> arbitrary <*> smaller genr
% \end{code}


% \subsection*{\textbf{Type Level Combinators}}

% The next step is to define a series of type level combinators to enable us
% combining the automatically derived |HRep|s in several ways.


% In first place, we define a type combinator (|term|) to tag a |HRep| to be
% terminal, i.e., a representation that is allowed be generated when the
% generation size gets exausted:
% %
% \begin{code}
% data (f_term) a = Term (f a)
% \end{code}

% Additionally, we define a combinator ($\otimes$) to tag a |HRep| with an
% explicit generation frequency $n$:

% \begin{code}
% data (f otimes n) a = Freq (f a)
% \end{code}

% The previous combinators only include information relevant to the generation
% process, in a sense that neither one adds new structure to the final
% representation.
% %
% In this light, they do not alter the evaluation semantics, and we translate them
% back to our target data type by evaluating the inner representation:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{4}
%   &\evalrep{Term\ x &&: |f_term|    &&}{t} &&= \evalrep{x : f}{t} \\
%   &\evalrep{Freq\ x &&: f \otimes n &&}{t} &&= \evalrep{x : f}{t}
% \end{alignat*}

% In the previous equations we explicitly annotate (using a colon) the type of the
% evaluated term for clarity.
% %
% Later, to generate these combinators is enough to wrap a generated value from
% the inner representation with the apropriate tag:

% \begin{code}
% gen_f_term     genr  = Term  <$> genf genr

% gen_f_times_n  genr  = Freq  <$> genf genr
% \end{code}


% Perhaps more interesting, we define a combinator $(\oplus)$ to compose two
% |HRep|s into a single one using a sum type to represent a random choice between
% them:

% \begin{code}
% data (f oplus g) a = L (f a) | R (g a)
% \end{code}

% A composite representation built using $(\oplus)$ is transformed back into the
% target data type by pattern matching on the data constructor variant and
% evaluating the inner |HRep| accodingly:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{3}
%   &\evalrep{L\ x &&: f \oplus g}{t} = \evalrep{x : f &&}{t} \\
%   &\evalrep{R\ x &&: f \oplus g}{t} = \evalrep{y : g &&}{t}
% \end{alignat*}

% Generating a composite |HRep| is slightly more complicated than before, as we
% need to perform a random choice based on the generation size and the given
% frequencies for each sub-represention:

% \begin{code}
%   gen_f_plus_g genr  = sized (\size ->
%     if size == 0
%     then frequency
%       [ (freq0  at_f,  L  <$> genf  genr  )
%       , (freq0  at_g,  R  <$> geng  genr  ) ]
%     else frequency
%       [ (freq   at_f,  L  <$> genf  genr  )
%       , (freq   at_g,  R  <$> geng  genr  ) ])
% \end{code} %$

% In the previous definition, we reflect the type level frequencies of the types
% |f| and |g| (|freq at_f| and |freq at_g|) into term-level values.
% %
% This reflection defaults to $1$ if the frequency tag ($\otimes$) is not present.
% %
% Then we use these frequencies to generate each inner |HRep| in the apropriate
% proportion.
% %
% When the generation size gets exhausted, we reflect the terminal generation
% frequency of each inner |HRep| in the same way as before (|freq0 at_f| and
% |freq0 at_g|).
% %
% This time, however, we default the frequency reflection to $0$ for any inner
% that not tagged as terminal, avoiding to generate non-terminal constructions in
% the last step.


% Later, we can use these combinators to create a type synonym |HRepHtml| that
% specifies a generation schema equivalent to the one seen in the concrete random
% generator of type |Html| presented in Section \ref{sec:randomtesting}:

% \begin{code}
% type HRepHtml  =       HRepText_term  otimes 2
%                oplus'  HRepSing_term
%                oplus'  HRepJoin       otimes 3
%                oplus'  HRepTag        otimes 4
% \end{code}

% However, a value of type |HRepHtml| still has its recursive calls abstracted
% away---the type parameter |r| is implicit at the definition of |HRepHtml|.
% %
% We can think of it as a ``single layer'' of representation.
% %
% To make it able to represent recursive values we need to define a last type
% level combinator to ``tie the knot'':

% \begin{code}
%   data Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
% \end{code}

% This datatype represents the \emph{fixed point} of a parametric data type |f|,
% i.e., a data type where each recursive call gets instantiated with iself.
% %
% Then, to translate fixed points back to our target data type we simply need
% translate the inner representation:
% %
% \begin{align*}
%   \evalrep{Fix\ x : Fix\ f}{t} = \evalrep{x : f}{t}
% \end{align*}

% % Categorically, this generic transformation of fixed points is called a
% % \emph{catamorphism}, where our evaluation relation is known as its
% % \emph{algebra} \tocite.


% Unlike the other combinators, to define a random generator for the fixed point
% of a certain representation |f|, we do not to parametrize the generation of the
% recursive fields of |f| over an external generator |genr|.
% %
% % Instead, we simply pipe the generation to the inner |HRep|, calling itself on
% Instead, we replace it with our fixed point generator, calling itself
% recursively on any recursive field of |f| that might appear inside:

% \begin{code}
% genFix_f = Fix <$> genf genFix_f
% \end{code} %$

% This way we obtain a concrete recursive generator for each representation |f|
% that we define.
% %
% Then, we can define a random generator for our target data type simply by
% generating a random value of our chosen representation, and transforming it back
% to our target by the means of the evaluation relation:

% \begin{code}
%   genHtml = do  x <- genFix_HRep_Html
%                 return eval_x_Html
% \end{code} %$


% So far we have introduced the machinery required to represent the random
% generation of a target data type considering only the structure encoded on its
% definition.
% %
% However, this approach can now be easily extended to encode different sources of
% structured information.
% %
% We proceed to introduce two extensions that help to address the problematic
% testing scenarios presented in the previous section.


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Pattern Matchings}}

% We can follow a similar reasoning as before to represent the pattern matching
% structure from a given function.
% %
% Consider the nested pattern matchings of function |simpl| defined in the
% previous section:

% \begin{code}
% simpl (Join (Text t1) (Text t2))   = ...
% simpl (Join (Join (Text t1) x) y)  = ...
% \end{code}

% To represent these patterns, we derive a new data for each one of them, whose
% fields represent the pattern variables that occur inside, and abstracting away
% every pattern variable of type |Html|.
% %
% Concretely, we define the following data types:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepSimpl1  r = PatSimpl1 String String
% data HRepSimpl2  r = PatSimpl2 String r r
% \end{code}

% The first pattern of |simpl| contains two pattern variables (|t1| and |t2|) of
% type |String| that are included as fields of |PatSimpl1|.
% %
% Similarly, the second pattern of |simpl| contains a pattern variable |t1| of
% type |String| represented by the first field of |PatSimpl2|, along with two
% pattern variables (|x| and |y|) of type |Html| that are abstracted in the second
% and third fields of |PatSimpl2|.

% To transform these representations back to our target data type, we simply need
% to expand them it into the concrete value represented by the original pattern,
% evaluating its fields back to |Html| as well:
% %
% \begin{align*}
%   &\evalrep{|PatSimpl1|\ t1\ t2}{Html} \\
%   &\quad = |Join (Text eval_t1_Html) (Text eval_t2_Html)|\\
%   &\evalrep{|PatSimpl2|\ t1\ x\ y}{Html} = \\
%   &\quad = |Join (Join (Text eval_t1_Html)) eval_x_Html) eval_y_Html)|
% \end{align*}

% This way, any value of type |HRepSimpl1| is guaranteed to satisfy the first
% pattern matching of |simpl|---the same property follows for |HRepSimpl2|.


% The random generation of pattern |HRep|s is defined in the same way as we did
% before for representations of data constructors:

% \begin{code}
% genSimpl1  genr
%   = PatSimpl1  <$> arbitrary  <*> arbitrary
% genSimpl2  genr
%   = PatSimpl2  <$> arbitrary <*> smaller genr <*> smaller genr
% \end{code} %$

% Finally, we can join the pattern matching representation of each clause of
% |simpl| into a single one:

% \begin{code}
% type HRepSimpl  = HRepSimpl1 oplus''  HRepSimpl2
% \end{code}


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Abstract Interfaces}}

% To introduce the higher level representation of module abstract interfaces,
% consider module |M| defininf |Html| combinators introduced in the previous
% section.

% % \begin{code}
% % module M where

% % ten :: Exp
% % ten = Val 10

% % square :: Exp -> Exp
% % square x = Mul x x

% % minus :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
% % minus x y = Add x (Mul y (Val (-1)))
% % \end{code}

% We can represent each function of |M| that returns a value of type |Html|
% following the same idea as before, deriving a data type with a single data
% constructor for each one of them:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepdiv        r = Fundiv r
% data HRepbold       r = Funbold r
% data HRephr         r = Funhr
% \end{code}

% In this case, each single constructor will have as fields the types of the
% inputs of the function that they represent.
% %
% As before, we abstract away any field representing and input of type |Html| with
% a type parameter |r|.


% To evaluate these representations, we simply use the values on its fields as
% input parameter of each original function, returning its result.
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{3}
%   &\evalrep{|Fundiv|\  &&x  &&}{Html} = |div eval_x_html| \\
%   &\evalrep{|Funbold|\ &&x &&}{Html} = |bold eval_x_html| \\
%   &\evalrep{|Funhr|    &&  &&}{Html} = |hr|
% \end{alignat*}

% Note that, by doing this, the generation process inherits any patology that the
% functions we use to generate values might have.
% %
% For instance, if the function |div| would happen to be non-terminating for some
% inputs, our generation process could suffer from this as well.


% Furthermore, the generation procedure for abstract interface representations
% follows the same pattern as before:

% \begin{code}
%   gendiv   genr  = Fundiv <$> smaller genr
%   genbold  genr  = Funbold <$> smaller genr
%   genhr    genr  = return Funhr
% \end{code} %$

% And we will also define a type synonym to join all the representations of the
% module |M| into a single one.

% \begin{code}
% type HRepM  = HRepdiv oplus''  HRepbold oplus''  HRephr
% \end{code}

% Finally, we can put all the derived machinery together into a generation
% specification |HtmlS|, assigning (possibly) different generation frequencies to
% each individual |HRep| we combine:

% \begin{code}
% type HtmlS  =       HRepHtml   otimes 4
%             oplus'  HRepSimpl  otimes 2
%             oplus'  HRepM
% \end{code}

% This previous definition can be interpreted graphically as it is shown in the
% Figure \ref{fig:hrep}, where curly arrows represent the structural information
% extracted using meta-programming.


% % \begin{figure}[t]
% %   \centering
% %   \input{tikz/val.tex}
% %   \caption{Some caption.}
% %   \label{fig:val}
% % \end{figure}


% We want to remark that, for space reasons, we were only able to introduce the
% representation of a rather simple target data type.
% %
% In practice, this reasoning can be extended to mutually recursive and parametric
% types as well.


% Overall, this approach offers significant advantages over the usual type-driven
% derivation of random generators:
% %
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Composability:} we can combine different atomic representations
%   using different structure information sources depending on what property or
%   sub-system we need to verify using randomly generated values.
%   %
% \item \textbf{Extensibility:} the developer can derive representations for new
%   sources of structure information and combine them with the existing ones
%   simply by adding them to the existing generation specification of the target
%   data type.
%   %
% \item \textbf{Predictability:} using branching processes theory, it is possible
%   to predict the average distribution of generated values in terms of number of
%   constructors.
%   %
%   This prediction is completely modular, and can be obtained for any composite
%   representation obtained using the automatically derived |HRep|s and the
%   provided combinators.
% \end{itemize}
