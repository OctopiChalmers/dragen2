\section{Sources of structural information}
\label{sec:sources}

% In this work we identify two sources of additional structure information which
% are not considered by the aforementioned automatic derivation tools to obtain
% better random data generators:

In this section, we describe the motivation for considering two additional
sources of structural information which lead us to obtain better random data
generators. %and how to represent them in our generation process.
%
% In this work we identify two patological situations which are not properly
% handled by the aforementioned derivation tools:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The target code behaves differently over inputs matching specific patterns
%   of nested values.
% \item The target code encodes a significant portion of its structure on its
%   abstract interface.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% In Section \ref{sec:hrep} we show how this structural information can be used to
% synthesize richer random generators automatically.
% %
We proceed to exemplify the need to consider such sources with examples.

\subsection{Branching on input data}

To exemplify the first source of structure information, we consider that we want
to use randomly generated |Html| values to test the function |simplify :: Html
-> Html|.
%
In Haskell, the notation |f :: T| means that program |f| has type |T|.
%
In our example, function |simplify| takes an |Html| as an input and produces an
|Html| value as an output---thus its type |Html -> Html|.
%
Intuitively, the purpose of this function is to assemble sequences of |Text|
constructors into a single big one.
%
More specifically, the code of |simplify| is as follows.
%
\todoale{Don't like the rendering of simplify!}
\begin{code}
simplify :: Html -> Html
simplify (Join (Text t1) (Text t2))
  = Text (concat t1 t2)
simplify (Join (Join (Text t1) x) y)
  = simplify (Join (Text t1) (simplify (Join x y)))
simplify (Join x y) = Join (simplify x) (simplify y)
simplify (Tag t x) = Tag t (simplify x)
simplify x = x
\end{code}
%
Function |concat| just concatenates two strings.
%
The body of |simplify| is described using \emph{pattern matching} over possible
kinds of |Html| values.
%
Pattern matching allows to define functions idiomatically by given different
function clauses for each input pattern we are interested in.
%
In other words, pattern matching is a mechanism that functions have to branch on
input arguments.
%
In the code above, we can see that |simplify| patterns match against sequences
of |Text| constructors combined by a |Join| constructor---see first and second
clauses.
%
Generally speaking, patterns can be defined to match specific constructors,
literal values or variable subexpressions (like |x| in the last clause of
|simplify|).
%
Patterns can also be nested in order to match very specific values.

% Patterns can be defined to match specific constructors, literal values or
% variable subexpressions (like |t|, |x| and |y| in the definition of |render|).
% %
% They can also be nested in order to match very specific patterns of values.
% This function simplifies sequences of |Text| constructors into a single big
% |Text| constructor.
% %
% To do so, it has to pattern match against sequences of |Text| constructors
% combined by a |Join| constructor using nested patterns (see |simpl| fist and
% second clauses).
% %
% The remaining clauses are only meant to propagate this simplification within
% nested expressions.


Ideally, we would like to put approximately the same amount of effort into
testing each clause of the function |simplify|.
 %approximately the same amount of
 %time each.
%
However, each data constructor is generated independently by those generators
automatically derived by just considering ADT definitions.
 %
Observe that the probability of generating a value satisfying a nested pattern
(like |Join (Text t1) (Text t2)|) decreases multiplicatively with the number of
constructors we simultaneously pattern against to.
%
As an evidence of that, in our tests, we found that the first two clauses of
|simplify| get exercised only approximately between $1.5\%$ and $6\%$ of the
time when using the state-of-the-art tools for automatically deriving
\quickcheck generators \megadeth \cite{GriecoCB16} and {\dragen}
\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/MistaRH18}.
 %
 %The best result we could achieve was with \dragen, which was able to exercise
 %the first and second clauses approximately $3\%$ and $6\%$ of the time,
 %respectively.
%
Most of the generated values were exercising the simplest clauses of our
function, i.e, |simplify (Join x y)|, |simplify (Tag t x)|, and |simplify x|.
% )|, in view of they pattern match against
% simpler patterns of input values.

% In this light, we found that using a random generator obtained with \megadeth to
% test this function will only exercise the first two clauses of |simpl| about
% only $1.5\%$ of the time each, relegating the rest of the generated test cases
% to the remaining and somewhat less interesting clauses, where, remarkably, half
% of the time is spent exercising the last trivial clause.
% %
% Furthermore, using \dragen to ...


% This function behaves very much like an identity function, with the exception
% that it fails for two very specific patterns of input values defined using
% nested pattern matching.
% %
% This is, |foo| does not only matches against the root data constructor, but also
% against the data constructors of its subexpressions and sub-subexpressions.


% \quickcheck's default implementation for random |Int|s pick a number in the
% interval $[-n, n]$ with uniform distribution.
% %
% Hence, in principle we need to recognize what is a suitable generation size,
% which should be big enough for our generator be able to generate the numbers we
% pattern match against to, otherwise we will not be able to generate any value to
% match against |foo| clauses, leaving fragments of code completely untested.
% %
% Suppose then that we pick the a generation size $50$, i.e. the minimum size that
% is big enough to produce an |Int| number equal to $50$.
% %
% Under this consideration, the probability of generating a value matching the
% first clause of |foo| (and hence triggering the first error) results as follows:
% %
% \begin{align*}
%   &P(match(foo\#1))\\
%   &\quad = P(Add)       * P(Add) * 1 * (P(Val) * (1/100)) \\
%   &\phantom{xxxxxxxxxx} * P(Add) * (P(Val) * (1/100)) * 1
% \end{align*}

% If we use \megadeth to automatically derive a random generator for |Exp|, we
% obtain a uniform generation probability distribution over constructors, i.e.,
% $P(|Val|) = P(|Add|) = P(|Mul|) = 1/3$.
% %
% In this setting, $P(match(foo\#1))$ results $1/2430000$, meaning that, in
% average, we will need to generate over than two million test cases in order to
% be able to test the first clause of |foo| only once.
% %
% This situation can be somewhat improved if we use \dragen to obtain a random
% generator.
% %
% Using this tool, we can optimize the generation probabilities in order to
% benefit the generation of some data constructors over the rest.
% %
% Considering that the first pattern matching of |foo| involves the data
% constructor |Add| as the only recursive one, we can set an target generation
% proportion of |Add| data constructors of, for instance, $20:1$ with respect to
% the rest of the generated data constructors.
% %
% By doing so, the obtained distribution of values results such that
% $P(match(foo\#1)) \approx 1/300000$.
% %
% Although this certainly improves the probability of generating a matching value,
% this probability is not substantial enough to become practical.


% Additionally, by favoring the generation probabilities towards the |Add|
% constructor, we found that the probability of generating a value matching the
% second clause of |foo| (which does not matches against it) also gets diminished
% into an impractival value.

Altough the previous example might seem rather simple, branching against
specific patterns of the input data is not an uncommon task.
%
In that light, and in order to obtain interesting test cases, it is desirable to
conceive generators able to produce random values capable to exercise patterns
with certain frequency---Section \ref{sec:hrepcont} shows how to do so.
%a good source of information to improve.


% For instance, balancing a
% Red-Black tree requires to consider specific combinations of color, left and
% right subtrees and sub-subtrees in order to preserve the height invariant
% \tocite.
% %
% Moreover, Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) is a compiler optimization that
% needs to consider very specific sequences of instructions that may be regrouped
% in a computationally more efficient way, to cite a few \tocite.

\subsection{Abstract interfaces}

A common choice when implementing ADTs is to transfer the responsibility of
preserving structural invariants to the interfaces that manipulate values of
such types.
%
To illustrate this point, let us consider three new primitives responsible to
handle |Html| data as shown in Fig \ref{fig:htmlint}.
%
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.225\textwidth}
\vspace{-10pt}
\hspace{-10pt}
\begin{code}
hr :: Html
hr = Single "hr"

div :: Html -> Html
div x = Tag "div" x

bold :: Html -> Html
bold x = Tag "b" x
\end{code}
\caption{Abtract interface of the type |Html|.}
\label{fig:htmlint}
\vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}
%
% In the previous definition, the |Html| data type is defined using a single data
% constructor that contains the textual representation of the Html code it
% represents in plain text.
%
These functions encode additional information about the structure of |Html|
values in the form of specific Html tags.
%
Primitive |hr| represents the tag \texttt{<hr>} used to separate content in an
HTML pages.
%
Function |div| and |bold| place an |Html| value within the tags \texttt{div} and
\texttt{b} in order to introduce divisions and activate bold fonts,
respectively.
%
For instance, the page \texttt{<html><b>hello</b><hr>bye</html>} can be encoded
as:

\begin{code}
Tag "html" (Join (Join
  (bold (Text "hello")) hr) (Text "bye"))
\end{code}

%
Observe that, instead of including a new data constructor for each possible HTML
tag in the |Html| definition (recall Section \ref{sec:randomtesting}), we
defined a minimal general representation with a set of high-level primitives to
build valid |Html| tags.
%
% These combinators functions defined over |HTML| are the ones in charge of
% transforming this plain text representation with the invariant that, given valid
% |Html| parameters, they always return a valid |Html| value.
%
This programming pattern is often found in a variety of Haskell libraries.
%
%being \emph{html} \tocite, \emph{svg-builder} \tocite some examples of this.
%
As a consequence of this practice, generators derived by only looking into ADT
definitions often fail to synthesize useful random values, e.g., random HTML
pages with valid tags.
%
After all, most of the \emph{valid structures} of values has been encoded into
the primitives of the ADT abstract interface.
%
When considering the generator described in Section \ref{sec:randomtesting}, the
chances of generating a |Tag| value representing a commonly used HTML tag such
as |div| or |b| are extremely low.


% Additionally, if our test suite contains properties constrained by certain
% preconditions, the lack of domain knowleadge may lead in an impractically high
% discard ratio of randomly generated test cases.
% %%
% For instance, suposse we write a property to verify that |render| always outputs
% a valid |Html| value:

% \begin{code}
% prop_render :: Html -> Bool
% prop_render x = valid x ===> valid (parse (render x))
% \end{code}

% In the previous definition we state that |render| always returns a valid |Html|
% value when it is parsed again (|parse (render x)|), provided that we are given a
% valid |Html| as input (|valid x|).
% %
% In practice, not every string of characters constitutes a valid Html given that
% some special characters need to be escaped (``<'', ``>'', ``&'', etc.).

% %
% While testing this property we rarely satisfy its precondition, in which case
% \quickcheck discards the whole test, retrying with a diferent random input,
% degradating this way the testing performance.


% \begin{code}
% text :: String -> Bool
% text str = Text (addEscapes str)
% \end{code}

% We believe that, if certain patterns of values are relevant enough to appear in
% the codebase being tested, a practical random testing methodology should be able
% to produce values satisfying such patterns in a substantial proportion.

So far, we have introduced two scenarios where derivation approaches based only
on ADT definitions are unable to capture all the available structural
information from the user codebase.
%
Fortunately, this information can be automatically exploited and used to
generate interesting and more structured random values.
%
The next section introduces a model capable to encode structural information
presented in this section into our automatically derived random generators in a
modular and flexible way.



% \section{Capturing ADTs Structure} \label{sec:hrep}




% In this section we present a compositional representation of values to express
% the random generation of values following the internal structure of their data
% types along with the structure present on patterns matchings and abstract
% interfaces.


% The key idea of this work is to represent different structured constructions of
% data in a homogeneous way that we call a ``higher-level representation'' (|HRep|
% from now on).
% %
% Instead of generating each data constructor independently, a random generator
% derived from this representation might generate composite structured values on
% each random choice it performs.
% %
% % \footnote{The notion of higher-level comes from that the generation process is
% %   entirely determined by the type of the chosen type level representation,
% %   instead of by a concrete generator defined at the term level.}
% %
% For this purpose, we use a series of automatically derived data types, each one
% representing an atomic unit of information that can be randomly generated and
% then reflected back to the corresponding value of the original data type.
% %
% Later, the user can compose these atomic representations using the provided type
% level combinators in different ways into a ``generation specification'' that
% completely determines the generation process behavior.


% We wil reuse the previously defined data type |Html| and the functions defined
% in the previous section to explain the different concepts involved all across
% this section.


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Data Constructors}}

% We begin by introducing the simplest data type representation that we can
% extract from our codebase: the representation of single data constructor.
% %
% Each data constructor can be represented by an automatically derived data type
% consisting of a single constructor with the same fields as the original, except
% for the recursive ones that are abstracted away.
% %
% In this light, we represent each constructor of the data type |Html| as follows:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepText  r = ConText  String
% data HRepSing  r = ConSing  String
% data HRepJoin  r = ConJoin  r r
% data HRepTag   r = ConTag   String r
% \end{code}

% Note that the previous definitions are type parametric over the type parameter
% |r|.
% %
% This allow us to replace |r| with any concrete data type, obtaining different
% possible values on each case.
% %
% For instance, the value (|ConJoin 10 20|) has type |HRepJoin Int|, while the
% value (|ConJoin True False|) has type |HRepJoin Bool|.


% In practice, this parametricity let us instatiate |r| with the type of the
% chosen generation specification (which might be composed of several |HRep|s),
% without having to modify anything in the underlying machinery.


% Having the |HRep| of each data constructor, we can define an evaluation relation
% ($\evalrep{\_}{t} : \hrep{f} \rightarrow t$) that maps a value from each
% representation |f| back to the target data type |t|.
% %
% Then, we simply need to translate each constructor representation back into its
% corresponding one, translating the abstracted fields recursively:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{4}
%   &\evalrep{|ConText|\ s &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Text|\ s \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConSing|\ s &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Sing|\ s \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConJoin|\ x\ y &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Join|\ \evalrep{x}{Html}\ \evalrep{y}{Html} \\
%   &\evalrep{|ConTag|\ s\ x &&}{Html}
%     &&= |Tag|\ s\ \evalrep{x}{Html}
% \end{alignat*}

% The missing piece is to automatically synthesize a random generators for each
% constructor representation.
% %
% For this purpose, it is important to consider that each constructor |HRep| has
% its recursive fields abstracted away with a type parameter that will be later
% instantiated with the generation specification type.
% %
% Given that this specification is unknown at the derivation time, we parametrize
% each |HRep| generator with a random generator |genr| that is used to generate
% random values for each recursive field:

% \begin{code}
%   genText  genr  = ConText  <$> arbitrary
%   genSing  genr  = ConSing  <$> arbitrary
%   genJoin  genr  = ConJoin  <$> smaller genr <*> smaller genr
%   genTag   genr  = ConTag   <$> arbitrary <*> smaller genr
% \end{code}


% \subsection*{\textbf{Type Level Combinators}}

% The next step is to define a series of type level combinators to enable us
% combining the automatically derived |HRep|s in several ways.


% In first place, we define a type combinator (|term|) to tag a |HRep| to be
% terminal, i.e., a representation that is allowed be generated when the
% generation size gets exausted:
% %
% \begin{code}
% data (f_term) a = Term (f a)
% \end{code}

% Additionally, we define a combinator ($\otimes$) to tag a |HRep| with an
% explicit generation frequency $n$:

% \begin{code}
% data (f otimes n) a = Freq (f a)
% \end{code}

% The previous combinators only include information relevant to the generation
% process, in a sense that neither one adds new structure to the final
% representation.
% %
% In this light, they do not alter the evaluation semantics, and we translate them
% back to our target data type by evaluating the inner representation:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{4}
%   &\evalrep{Term\ x &&: |f_term|    &&}{t} &&= \evalrep{x : f}{t} \\
%   &\evalrep{Freq\ x &&: f \otimes n &&}{t} &&= \evalrep{x : f}{t}
% \end{alignat*}

% In the previous equations we explicitly annotate (using a colon) the type of the
% evaluated term for clarity.
% %
% Later, to generate these combinators is enough to wrap a generated value from
% the inner representation with the apropriate tag:

% \begin{code}
% gen_f_term     genr  = Term  <$> genf genr

% gen_f_times_n  genr  = Freq  <$> genf genr
% \end{code}


% Perhaps more interesting, we define a combinator $(\oplus)$ to compose two
% |HRep|s into a single one using a sum type to represent a random choice between
% them:

% \begin{code}
% data (f oplus g) a = L (f a) | R (g a)
% \end{code}

% A composite representation built using $(\oplus)$ is transformed back into the
% target data type by pattern matching on the data constructor variant and
% evaluating the inner |HRep| accodingly:
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{3}
%   &\evalrep{L\ x &&: f \oplus g}{t} = \evalrep{x : f &&}{t} \\
%   &\evalrep{R\ x &&: f \oplus g}{t} = \evalrep{y : g &&}{t}
% \end{alignat*}

% Generating a composite |HRep| is slightly more complicated than before, as we
% need to perform a random choice based on the generation size and the given
% frequencies for each sub-represention:

% \begin{code}
%   gen_f_plus_g genr  = sized (\size ->
%     if size == 0
%     then frequency
%       [ (freq0  at_f,  L  <$> genf  genr  )
%       , (freq0  at_g,  R  <$> geng  genr  ) ]
%     else frequency
%       [ (freq   at_f,  L  <$> genf  genr  )
%       , (freq   at_g,  R  <$> geng  genr  ) ])
% \end{code} %$

% In the previous definition, we reflect the type level frequencies of the types
% |f| and |g| (|freq at_f| and |freq at_g|) into term-level values.
% %
% This reflection defaults to $1$ if the frequency tag ($\otimes$) is not present.
% %
% Then we use these frequencies to generate each inner |HRep| in the apropriate
% proportion.
% %
% When the generation size gets exhausted, we reflect the terminal generation
% frequency of each inner |HRep| in the same way as before (|freq0 at_f| and
% |freq0 at_g|).
% %
% This time, however, we default the frequency reflection to $0$ for any inner
% that not tagged as terminal, avoiding to generate non-terminal constructions in
% the last step.


% Later, we can use these combinators to create a type synonym |HRepHtml| that
% specifies a generation schema equivalent to the one seen in the concrete random
% generator of type |Html| presented in Section \ref{sec:randomtesting}:

% \begin{code}
% type HRepHtml  =       HRepText_term  otimes 2
%                oplus'  HRepSing_term
%                oplus'  HRepJoin       otimes 3
%                oplus'  HRepTag        otimes 4
% \end{code}

% However, a value of type |HRepHtml| still has its recursive calls abstracted
% away---the type parameter |r| is implicit at the definition of |HRepHtml|.
% %
% We can think of it as a ``single layer'' of representation.
% %
% To make it able to represent recursive values we need to define a last type
% level combinator to ``tie the knot'':

% \begin{code}
%   data Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
% \end{code}

% This datatype represents the \emph{fixed point} of a parametric data type |f|,
% i.e., a data type where each recursive call gets instantiated with iself.
% %
% Then, to translate fixed points back to our target data type we simply need
% translate the inner representation:
% %
% \begin{align*}
%   \evalrep{Fix\ x : Fix\ f}{t} = \evalrep{x : f}{t}
% \end{align*}

% % Categorically, this generic transformation of fixed points is called a
% % \emph{catamorphism}, where our evaluation relation is known as its
% % \emph{algebra} \tocite.


% Unlike the other combinators, to define a random generator for the fixed point
% of a certain representation |f|, we do not to parametrize the generation of the
% recursive fields of |f| over an external generator |genr|.
% %
% % Instead, we simply pipe the generation to the inner |HRep|, calling itself on
% Instead, we replace it with our fixed point generator, calling itself
% recursively on any recursive field of |f| that might appear inside:

% \begin{code}
% genFix_f = Fix <$> genf genFix_f
% \end{code} %$

% This way we obtain a concrete recursive generator for each representation |f|
% that we define.
% %
% Then, we can define a random generator for our target data type simply by
% generating a random value of our chosen representation, and transforming it back
% to our target by the means of the evaluation relation:

% \begin{code}
%   genHtml = do  x <- genFix_HRep_Html
%                 return eval_x_Html
% \end{code} %$


% So far we have introduced the machinery required to represent the random
% generation of a target data type considering only the structure encoded on its
% definition.
% %
% However, this approach can now be easily extended to encode different sources of
% structured information.
% %
% We proceed to introduce two extensions that help to address the problematic
% testing scenarios presented in the previous section.


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Pattern Matchings}}

% We can follow a similar reasoning as before to represent the pattern matching
% structure from a given function.
% %
% Consider the nested pattern matchings of function |simpl| defined in the
% previous section:

% \begin{code}
% simpl (Join (Text t1) (Text t2))   = ...
% simpl (Join (Join (Text t1) x) y)  = ...
% \end{code}

% To represent these patterns, we derive a new data for each one of them, whose
% fields represent the pattern variables that occur inside, and abstracting away
% every pattern variable of type |Html|.
% %
% Concretely, we define the following data types:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepSimpl1  r = PatSimpl1 String String
% data HRepSimpl2  r = PatSimpl2 String r r
% \end{code}

% The first pattern of |simpl| contains two pattern variables (|t1| and |t2|) of
% type |String| that are included as fields of |PatSimpl1|.
% %
% Similarly, the second pattern of |simpl| contains a pattern variable |t1| of
% type |String| represented by the first field of |PatSimpl2|, along with two
% pattern variables (|x| and |y|) of type |Html| that are abstracted in the second
% and third fields of |PatSimpl2|.

% To transform these representations back to our target data type, we simply need
% to expand them it into the concrete value represented by the original pattern,
% evaluating its fields back to |Html| as well:
% %
% \begin{align*}
%   &\evalrep{|PatSimpl1|\ t1\ t2}{Html} \\
%   &\quad = |Join (Text eval_t1_Html) (Text eval_t2_Html)|\\
%   &\evalrep{|PatSimpl2|\ t1\ x\ y}{Html} = \\
%   &\quad = |Join (Join (Text eval_t1_Html)) eval_x_Html) eval_y_Html)|
% \end{align*}

% This way, any value of type |HRepSimpl1| is guaranteed to satisfy the first
% pattern matching of |simpl|---the same property follows for |HRepSimpl2|.


% The random generation of pattern |HRep|s is defined in the same way as we did
% before for representations of data constructors:

% \begin{code}
% genSimpl1  genr
%   = PatSimpl1  <$> arbitrary  <*> arbitrary
% genSimpl2  genr
%   = PatSimpl2  <$> arbitrary <*> smaller genr <*> smaller genr
% \end{code} %$

% Finally, we can join the pattern matching representation of each clause of
% |simpl| into a single one:

% \begin{code}
% type HRepSimpl  = HRepSimpl1 oplus''  HRepSimpl2
% \end{code}


% \subsection*{\textbf{Representing Abstract Interfaces}}

% To introduce the higher level representation of module abstract interfaces,
% consider module |M| defininf |Html| combinators introduced in the previous
% section.

% % \begin{code}
% % module M where

% % ten :: Exp
% % ten = Val 10

% % square :: Exp -> Exp
% % square x = Mul x x

% % minus :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp
% % minus x y = Add x (Mul y (Val (-1)))
% % \end{code}

% We can represent each function of |M| that returns a value of type |Html|
% following the same idea as before, deriving a data type with a single data
% constructor for each one of them:

% \begin{code}
% data HRepdiv        r = Fundiv r
% data HRepbold       r = Funbold r
% data HRephr         r = Funhr
% \end{code}

% In this case, each single constructor will have as fields the types of the
% inputs of the function that they represent.
% %
% As before, we abstract away any field representing and input of type |Html| with
% a type parameter |r|.


% To evaluate these representations, we simply use the values on its fields as
% input parameter of each original function, returning its result.
% %
% \begin{alignat*}{3}
%   &\evalrep{|Fundiv|\  &&x  &&}{Html} = |div eval_x_html| \\
%   &\evalrep{|Funbold|\ &&x &&}{Html} = |bold eval_x_html| \\
%   &\evalrep{|Funhr|    &&  &&}{Html} = |hr|
% \end{alignat*}

% Note that, by doing this, the generation process inherits any patology that the
% functions we use to generate values might have.
% %
% For instance, if the function |div| would happen to be non-terminating for some
% inputs, our generation process could suffer from this as well.


% Furthermore, the generation procedure for abstract interface representations
% follows the same pattern as before:

% \begin{code}
%   gendiv   genr  = Fundiv <$> smaller genr
%   genbold  genr  = Funbold <$> smaller genr
%   genhr    genr  = return Funhr
% \end{code} %$

% And we will also define a type synonym to join all the representations of the
% module |M| into a single one.

% \begin{code}
% type HRepM  = HRepdiv oplus''  HRepbold oplus''  HRephr
% \end{code}

% Finally, we can put all the derived machinery together into a generation
% specification |HtmlS|, assigning (possibly) different generation frequencies to
% each individual |HRep| we combine:

% \begin{code}
% type HtmlS  =       HRepHtml   otimes 4
%             oplus'  HRepSimpl  otimes 2
%             oplus'  HRepM
% \end{code}

% This previous definition can be interpreted graphically as it is shown in the
% Figure \ref{fig:hrep}, where curly arrows represent the structural information
% extracted using meta-programming.

%   \centering
%   \input{tikz/hrep.tex}
%   \caption{Higher-level representation of the data type |Html|, defined using
%     structural information from the function |simpl| and the abstract interface
%     of the module |M|.}

% %   \label{fig:val}
% % \end{figure}


% We want to remark that, for space reasons, we were only able to introduce the
% representation of a rather simple target data type.
% %
% In practice, this reasoning can be extended to mutually recursive and parametric
% types as well.


% Overall, this approach offers significant advantages over the usual type-driven
% derivation of random generators:
% %
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Composability:} we can combine different atomic representations
%   using different structure information sources depending on what property or
%   sub-system we need to verify using randomly generated values.
%   %
% \item \textbf{Extensibility:} the developer can derive representations for new
%   sources of structure information and combine them with the existing ones
%   simply by adding them to the existing generation specification of the target
%   data type.
%   %
% \item \textbf{Predictability:} using branching processes theory, it is possible
%   to predict the average distribution of generated values in terms of number of
%   constructors.
%   %
%   This prediction is completely modular, and can be obtained for any composite
%   representation obtained using the automatically derived |HRep|s and the
%   provided combinators.
% \end{itemize}
